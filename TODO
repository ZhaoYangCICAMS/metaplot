Vignette needs more examples and modifications. Code from
tests/testing_metaplot_package.r, examples in man pages and Edna's
thesis can be used.

In parDefaults in metaPar.R, there are global assignments. Are these
ok, or will they cause problems when trying to put the package on
CRAN.

Also, what does this code do?
metaParDefaultsFuns <- parDefaults()
metaParDefaults <- metaParDefaultsFuns$set
## reset default settings
resetDefaults <- metaParDefaultsFuns$reset


Note that only print method for data frame is for metabinDF. Other
methods are needed.
In heteroGen.R, only metabinDF option treated. Also default format
gives the same message for grouped as for overall. Grouped should
perhaps be
"Test for group effect: "
instead of
"Test for overall effect: "

Is metabinStat still needed? It appears in
tests/testing_metaplot_package.r, which will need modification also.

Need to sort out heterogeneity tests based coming from different packages.
meta.DSL and meta.MH give Woolf's test for heterogeneity.

Should meta.DSL and meta.MH be combined to provide full information
for object of type metabinDF?

In hetero for meta.MH and meta.DSL there are values for
conf.level. Not clear what value should be there and how it should be
treated.
