Vignette needs more examples and modifications

In parDefaults in metaPar.R, there are global assignments. Are these
ok, or will they cause problems when trying to put the package on
CRAN.

Also, what does this code do?
metaParDefaultsFuns <- parDefaults()
metaParDefaults <- metaParDefaultsFuns$set
## reset default settings
resetDefaults <- metaParDefaultsFuns$reset


Note that only print method for data frame is for metabinDF. Other
methods are needed.
In heteroGen.R, only metabinDF option treated. Also default format
gives the same message for grouped as for overall. Grouped should
perhaps be
"Test for group effect: "
instead of
"Test for overall effect: "

mainGen only deals with metabin and metacont cases. What about others?
Likewise drawMeta only has methods for metabin and metacont.

Is metabinStat still needed?
